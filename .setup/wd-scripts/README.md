# wd-scripts

This is a set of scripts that are meant to work with [Waydroid-Settings GTK app](https://github.com/axel358/Waydroid-Settings) but can work independently as standalone scripts too. 

The scripts all require the Waydroid container and session to be running in order to complete their tasks. Each script will have it's own -h (help) option to give further information. 

## Scripts (so far):

  add-foss-apps.sh - This will download the latest versions available from fdroid for MicroG, Aurora Store, Aurora Droid, a web browser and other basic apps
  connect_android_studio.sh - This will connect/disconnect Waydroid through ADB for Android-Studio automatically
  toggle_keyboard.sh - This will enable/disable the AOSP on-screen keyboard on Waydroid
